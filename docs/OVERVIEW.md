# Overview

XcodeBuildMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Xcode operations as tools and resources for AI assistants and other MCP clients. It uses a plugin-based architecture with workflow groups so clients can access Xcode projects, simulators, devices, and Swift packages through a standard interface.

## Why it exists
- Standardizes Xcode interactions for AI agents instead of ad-hoc command lines.
- Reduces configuration errors by providing purpose-built tools.
- Enables agents to build, inspect errors, and iterate autonomously.

## What it can do
- Xcode project discovery, build, test, and clean.
- Simulator and device app lifecycle management.
- Swift Package Manager build, test, and run.
- UI automation, screenshots, and video capture.
- Log capture and system diagnostics.
